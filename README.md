    The double chromesphere
</h2>
<hr>
The double chromesphere is a popular lottery play in China. 
The detail rules for the game can be seen at <a href="https://baike.baidu.com/item/中国福利彩票双色球/8676030?fromtitle=双色球&fromid=75279">here</a>.<br>
This program is created for my AP Computer Principle test as the creative performance task. <br><br>
To run the program, the user can input the blue sphere number and red sphere number, and the program will automatically generate the prize numbers and compare them with the user-chosen numbers. Finally it will output the result of whether the user wins a prize and the prize number. <br>
The program is created in JavaSE 11. You can download it and compile it by yourself.
